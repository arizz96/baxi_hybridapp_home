## Features

### 🌡️ Temperature Sensors
- **External Temperature** — ambient outdoor temperature
- **Internal Temperature** — indoor room temperature (if available)
- **Boiler Flow Temperature** — heating circuit flow temperature
- **DHW Storage Temperature** — domestic hot water storage temperature
- **DHW Auxiliary Storage Temperature** — auxiliary tank temperature
- **PDC Exit Temperature** — heat pump outlet temperature
- **PDC Return Temperature** — heat pump return temperature
- **Setpoint Mandata PDC (Calcolato)** — firmware-calculated target flow temperature for the heat pump in heating mode (same value whether it's currently producing DHW or heating the floor loop)
- **Sanitary Setpoint Instantaneous** — current target DHW temperature
- **Sanitary Setpoint Comfort** — comfort mode setpoint
- **Sanitary Setpoint Eco** — eco mode setpoint
- **Cooling Setpoint** — cooling flow setpoint (7–30 °C, disabled by default)

### 💧 Pressure Sensor
- **Water Pressure** — hydraulic circuit pressure (bar)

### ⚡ Power and Flow Sensors
- **Boiler Instantaneous Power** — current boiler power output
- **PDC Instantaneous Power** — current heat pump power output
- **Portata PDC** — heat pump flow rate (L/h)
- **COP Atteso** — expected heat pump COP, interpolated from the manufacturer's Capacity Tables using current external temperature and the PDC's target flow temperature
- **Potenza Termica Attesa (Pt)** — expected thermal power output (kW), same interpolation
- **Potenza Elettrica Attesa (Pel)** — expected electric power draw (kW), same interpolation

The three "attesa/expected" sensors are computed, not read from the cloud: they look up the manufacturer's published Capacity Tables (EN 14511, "valori medi") for your detected device model and interpolate on external temperature × flow temperature. The flow-temperature input is `pdc_heating_setpoint_temp` ("Set point mandata PDC caldo (calcolato)") — the *target* flow temperature the firmware itself calculates for the heat pump in heating mode ("caldo" vs. "freddo"/cooling, not DHW vs. floor heating). The heat pump serves both the DHW tank and the floor heating circuit, one at a time, through a diverter valve, and this calculated setpoint is already the same value regardless of which of the two it's currently serving — no extra logic needed here to tell them apart. There's no fallback to a measured reading (`pdc_exit_temp`/`boiler_flow_temp`) if a device model doesn't publish that metric: these sensors just stay `unavailable` rather than estimating from a value that could be stale/residual while the compressor is idle. The calculated setpoint can also report a low placeholder value while the PDC is idle (observed: 10 °C with 30 °C outside, no active heat demand) instead of a real target. These sensors require `status_pdc` (PDC Status) to be different from `"0000"` (the confirmed off code) when that metric is published; if it isn't, they fall back to `power_pdc` (PDC instantaneous power) being above zero, and if neither is available, to checking the setpoint against the Capacity Table's own range — it only publishes data from 25 °C flow upward, so anything below that is treated as "no active request" regardless. Currently only the **AWHP2R 8MR** model is catalogued (see [`capacity_tables.py`](custom_components/baxi_hybridapp_home/capacity_tables.py)); on any other model these sensors stay `unavailable`. More models can be added over time by contributing their Capacity Tables PDF.

### 🧭 Mode / Status Sensors
- **System Mode** — current operating mode (Automatico, Standby, Solo Sanitario)
- **System Operation Mode** — firmware-level operating mode (Automatico, Standby, Solo Sanitario)
- **Season Mode** — current seasonal configuration (Estate, Inverno, Estate/Inverno automatico, Estate/Inverno remoto)
- **Sanitary On** — whether sanitary mode is active (On / Off)
- **Scheduler Status** — DHW scheduler state (active, off, or error)
- **Flame Status** — whether the boiler flame is currently active (On / Off)
- **Boiler Status** — boiler state (On / Off)
- **PDC Status** — heat pump state (On / Avvio / Off; "Avvio" is the short start-up phase)
- **Holiday Mode** — whether holiday mode is active (On / Off)
- **Holiday Mode End** — end date/time of the active holiday period (unknown while holiday mode is off)
- **System Operation Icon** — icon code from the Baxi cloud status (disabled by default)
- **Riscaldamento in corso** — heating is running right now (On / Off)
- **Sanitario in corso** — domestic hot water is being produced right now (On / Off)
- **Resistenze** — electric heaters state (On / Off; Off when they are not enabled)
- **Richiesta Riscaldamento (TA)** — state of the room thermostat contact 31/31 (On / Off, disabled by default). With the external Wi-Fi control panel this contact is usually bridged and always reads On: use **Riscaldamento in corso** instead.
- **Segnale WiFi** — WiFi signal of the system gateway (dBm, diagnostic)

### ⏱️ Daily Time per Mode
Time spent today in each mode: heat pump, boiler, heating, cooling, DHW, solar thermal and standby. The value grows during the day and restarts from zero at midnight; it is shown in minutes and recorded in long-term statistics. All are **disabled by default**.

### ⚡ Energy Sensors
All energy sensors are disabled by default and use `TOTAL_INCREASING` state class (compatible with the HA Energy dashboard).

- **Energia totale PDC** — total heat pump energy consumption (kWh)
- **Energia totale caldaia** — total boiler energy consumption (kWh)
- **Energia totale resistenze** — total electric resistance energy (kWh)
- **Energia totale globale** — total system energy (kWh)
- **Energia totale globale per day** — daily total system energy (kWh)
- **Energia parziale caldaia** — partial boiler energy (kWh)
- **Energia parziale PDC** — partial heat pump energy (kWh)
- **Energia parziale resistenze** — partial electric resistance energy (kWh)

### 🔔 Alert Monitoring
The integration polls the Baxi cloud for historical FAILURE and WARNING alerts and exposes them as diagnostic entities.

- **Failure** — binary sensor (Problem / OK); active when a FAILURE alert is open
- **Warning** — binary sensor (Problem / OK); active when a WARNING alert is open (disabled by default)
- **Failure ultime 24h** — count of FAILURE alerts in the last 24 hours
- **Failure ultimi 7g** — count of FAILURE alerts in the last 7 days

Each new alert fires a `baxi_hybridapp_alert` event on the Home Assistant event bus, which can be used as a trigger for automations. The event payload includes `severity`, `code`, `description`, `title`, `start_ts`, and `end_ts`.

A ready-made **blueprint** for push notifications is included — see [blueprints/automation/baxi_hybridapp_home/notifica_avvisi.yaml](blueprints/automation/baxi_hybridapp_home/notifica_avvisi.yaml).

[![Import Blueprint](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FCm-8%2Fbaxi_hybridapp_home%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fbaxi_hybridapp_home%2Fnotifica_avvisi.yaml)

### 🎛️ Operating Mode Control
- **Modo Impianto** — select entity to switch between **Automatico**, **Solo Sanitario** and **Standby**; sends the command to the Baxi cloud instantly and refreshes the state
- **Modo Stagione** — select entity to switch the season mode between **Estate**, **Inverno**, **Estate/Inverno automatico** and **Estate/Inverno remoto**

### 🛁 Water Heater Entities
- **Sanitario Comfort** — adjustable DHW comfort temperature setpoint (30–52 °C)
- **Sanitario Eco** — adjustable DHW eco temperature setpoint (30–52 °C)

### 🚀 DHW Boost
- **Boost Sanitario** — button that starts the DHW boost
- **Stato Boost Sanitario** — boost state (On / Off)
- **Durata Boost Sanitario** — maximum boost duration (10–120 min, configuration entity)

### 🏖️ Holiday Mode Control
Mirrors the Baxi app's on/off flag, avoiding accidental sends. Both entities are **disabled by default** — enable them if you use holiday mode:
- **Modo Vacanza Fine** — datetime entity for the end date/time. When holiday mode is **off**, setting it only *stages* the value locally (nothing is sent) — you apply it with the switch. When holiday mode is already **on**, changing it is sent immediately (extend/shorten the period).
- **Modo Vacanza** — switch: turning it **on** sends the staged end date and activates holiday mode; turning it **off** disables it. Set the date first, then flip the switch.

### ❄️ Cooling Control
- **Setpoint Raffrescamento** — adjustable cooling flow setpoint (7–30 °C, number entity, disabled by default); automatable via the native `number.set_value` service (e.g. lower it when you have photovoltaic surplus)

### 🔘 Diagnostic Entities
- **Aggiorna** — button to manually trigger a data refresh
- **Test Failure** — button to simulate a FAILURE alert (only available with debug logging enabled)

### 🧩 Only the data your model has
At startup the integration reads the list of metrics of your device model from the Baxi cloud. Metrics the model does not have are not requested, and their entities are not created (if a previous version created them, they are removed). For example, **Flame Status** does not appear on all-electric systems.

### 🩺 Diagnostics
From the integration page (**⋮** > **Download diagnostics**) you can download a JSON report with the current sensor values, the full catalog of commands, configuration parameters and metrics supported by your device model, the last value of every metric in the catalog (also those the integration does not read yet), and the last 10 changes of every metric the integration reads. Downloading it takes a few seconds. Credentials, serial number, device ID, WiFi network name, gateway serial number and zone names are redacted. Attach it when opening an issue — it makes troubleshooting much faster, especially for device models not yet fully supported.

## Requirements

- A valid account for the [Baxi HybridApp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.baxi.HybridApp)
- Home Assistant version >= 2025.1.0

---

## Installation

### Manual

1. Copy the `baxi_hybridapp_home` folder into your `custom_components` directory.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

### Via HACS (Custom Repository)

1. In HACS, go to **Integrations** > **Custom Repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/Cm-8/baxi_hybridapp_home` as a new repository.
3. Search for **Baxi HybridApp Home** and install it.

---

## Configuration

After installation, configure the integration via the Home Assistant UI:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**.
2. Click **Add Integration** and search for `Baxi HybridApp Home`.
3. Enter your Baxi app credentials (email and password).

Credentials are validated against the Baxi cloud before the integration is created: if the login fails, the form shows a specific error (invalid credentials, connection problem, or unknown error).

If your password changes later, Home Assistant will automatically ask you to re-authenticate — just enter the new password, no need to remove and re-add the integration.

To update the credentials yourself at any time, open the integration and select **⋮** > **Reconfigure**. The account must stay the same: to add a different Baxi system, add a new integration.

Entity names and messages follow the Home Assistant language (Italian or English) and are shown with the device name in front, as usual in Home Assistant (for example *Baxi HybridApp Home Temp. Esterna*).

### Update interval

Data is read from the Baxi cloud every **5 minutes**. To change it, open the integration and select **Configure**: you can choose 2, 5 (recommended) or 10 minutes. The new interval applies right away, without restarting and without entering the password again. Shorter intervals mean more requests to the Baxi cloud.

For a custom schedule (for example every 2 minutes only during the day), use an automation with the `homeassistant.update_entity` action. **Updating a single entity of the integration updates all the others too**, so one entity is enough. Example every 2 minutes (replace the `entity_id` with the real one of your *External Temperature* sensor, from **Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **Entities**):

```yaml
- alias: "Baxi: aggiornamento ogni 2 minuti"
  triggers:
    - trigger: time_pattern
      minutes: "/2"
  actions:
    - action: homeassistant.update_entity
      target:
        entity_id: sensor.baxi_temperatura_esterna
```

Use an entity that is enabled (not, for example, an energy sensor disabled by default). Updates closer than 10 seconds are merged into one. If you want only the automation to decide when to update, disable the automatic updates in the integration's **⋮** > **System options**.

---

## Service actions

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| `baxi_hybridapp_home.set_comfort` | Sets the DHW **Comfort** setpoint (`value`: 30–52 °C) |
| `baxi_hybridapp_home.set_eco` | Sets the DHW **Eco** setpoint (`value`: 30–52 °C) |

```yaml
action: baxi_hybridapp_home.set_comfort
data:
  value: 45
```

The same actions are available as device actions in the automation editor. Like the controls, they show an error if the Baxi cloud rejects the request; the new value is confirmed from the cloud about 30 seconds later.

---

## Removal

1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**, open **Baxi HybridApp Home** and select **⋮** > **Delete**.
2. If you installed it via HACS, remove it from HACS; if you installed it manually, delete the `custom_components/baxi_hybridapp_home` folder.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

Removing the integration changes nothing on your Baxi system or in the Baxi app.

## Push Notification Blueprint

To receive push notifications on your phone when a Baxi alert is detected:

Click the button below to import the blueprint directly into your Home Assistant:

[![Import Blueprint](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FCm-8%2Fbaxi_hybridapp_home%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fbaxi_hybridapp_home%2Fnotifica_avvisi.yaml)

Or manually: **Settings** > **Automations & Scenes** > **Blueprints** > **Import Blueprint** and paste:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cm-8/baxi_hybridapp_home/main/blueprints/automation/baxi_hybridapp_home/notifica_avvisi.yaml
```

Then create an automation from the blueprint, select your mobile notify service and the desired severity filter.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **All entities unavailable** — no request to the Baxi cloud succeeded: the entities recover by themselves at the next successful refresh. Check that the Baxi app works.
- **A single entity unavailable** — your system has that metric but is not sending a value for it (for example, a component that is not installed). Entities for metrics your model does not have at all are not created.
- **"Sconosciuto (…)" value** — the cloud sent a code the integration does not know yet: open an issue saying which mode the system was in.
- **Debug logs** — add to `configuration.yaml` and restart:
  ```yaml
  logger:
    logs:
      custom_components.baxi_hybridapp_home: debug
  ```
- **Diagnostics** — integration page > **⋮** > **Download diagnostics**, then attach the file to the issue (credentials, serial number, device ID and personal values such as the WiFi network name are redacted; in the logs the serial number and the account and device IDs show only the last 4 characters).

---

## Limitations

- This is a cloud polling integration and requires an internet connection.
- Data is refreshed every 5 minutes by default (2, 5 or 10 minutes from **Configure**, see [Update interval](#update-interval)).
- Currently, only one Baxi system is supported per configuration entry.
