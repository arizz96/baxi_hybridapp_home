## Features

### 🌡️ Temperature Sensors
- **External Temperature** — ambient outdoor temperature
- **Internal Temperature** — indoor room temperature (if available)
- **Boiler Flow Temperature** — heating circuit flow temperature
- **DHW Storage Temperature** — domestic hot water storage temperature
- **DHW Auxiliary Storage Temperature** — auxiliary tank temperature
- **PDC Exit Temperature** — heat pump outlet temperature
- **PDC Return Temperature** — heat pump return temperature
- **Sanitary Setpoint Instantaneous** — current target DHW temperature
- **Sanitary Setpoint Comfort** — comfort mode setpoint
- **Sanitary Setpoint Eco** — eco mode setpoint
- **Cooling Setpoint** — cooling flow setpoint (7–30 °C, disabled by default)

### 💧 Pressure Sensor
- **Water Pressure** — hydraulic circuit pressure (bar)

### ⚡ Power Sensors
- **Boiler Instantaneous Power** — current boiler power output
- **PDC Instantaneous Power** — current heat pump power output
- **COP Atteso** — expected heat pump COP, interpolated from the manufacturer's Capacity Tables using current external and flow temperature
- **Potenza Termica Attesa (Pt)** — expected thermal power output (kW), same interpolation
- **Potenza Elettrica Attesa (Pel)** — expected electric power draw (kW), same interpolation

The three "attesa/expected" sensors are computed, not read from the cloud: they look up the manufacturer's published Capacity Tables (EN 14511, "valori medi") for your detected device model and interpolate on external/flow temperature. Currently only the **AWHP2R 8MR** model is catalogued (see [`capacity_tables.py`](custom_components/baxi_hybridapp_home/capacity_tables.py)); on any other model these sensors stay `unavailable`. More models can be added over time by contributing their Capacity Tables PDF.

### 🧭 Mode / Status Sensors
- **System Mode** — current operating mode (Automatico, Standby, Solo Sanitario)
- **System Operation Mode** — firmware-level operating mode (Automatico, Standby)
- **Season Mode** — current seasonal configuration (Estate, Inverno, Estate/Inverno automatico, Estate/Inverno remoto)
- **Sanitary On** — whether sanitary mode is active (On / Off)
- **Scheduler Status** — DHW scheduler state (active, off, or error)
- **Flame Status** — whether the boiler flame is currently active (On / Off)
- **Boiler Status** — current boiler state
- **PDC Status** — current heat pump state
- **Holiday Mode** — whether holiday mode is active (On / Off)
- **Holiday Mode End** — end date/time of the active holiday period
- **System Operation Icon** — icon code from the Baxi cloud status (disabled by default)

### ⚡ Energy Sensors
All energy sensors are disabled by default and use `TOTAL_INCREASING` state class (compatible with the HA Energy dashboard).

- **Energia totale PDC** — total heat pump energy consumption (kWh)
- **Energia totale caldaia** — total boiler energy consumption (kWh)
- **Energia totale resistenze** — total electric resistance energy (kWh)
- **Energia totale globale** — total system energy (kWh)
- **Energia totale globale per day** — daily total system energy (kWh)
- **Energia parziale caldaia** — partial boiler energy (kWh)
- **Energia parziale PDC** — partial heat pump energy (kWh)
- **Energia parziale resistenze** — partial electric resistance energy (kWh)

### 🔔 Alert Monitoring
The integration polls the Baxi cloud for historical FAILURE and WARNING alerts and exposes them as diagnostic entities.

- **Failure** — binary sensor (Problem / OK); active when a FAILURE alert is open
- **Warning** — binary sensor (Problem / OK); active when a WARNING alert is open (disabled by default)
- **Failure ultime 24h** — count of FAILURE alerts in the last 24 hours
- **Failure ultimi 7g** — count of FAILURE alerts in the last 7 days

Each new alert fires a `baxi_hybridapp_alert` event on the Home Assistant event bus, which can be used as a trigger for automations. The event payload includes `severity`, `code`, `description`, `title`, `start_ts`, and `end_ts`.

A ready-made **blueprint** for push notifications is included — see [blueprints/automation/baxi_hybridapp_home/notifica_avvisi.yaml](blueprints/automation/baxi_hybridapp_home/notifica_avvisi.yaml).

[![Import Blueprint](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FCm-8%2Fbaxi_hybridapp_home%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fbaxi_hybridapp_home%2Fnotifica_avvisi.yaml)

### 🎛️ Operating Mode Control
- **Modo Impianto** — select entity to switch between **Automatico**, **Solo Sanitario** and **Standby**; sends the command to the Baxi cloud instantly and refreshes the state
- **Modo Stagione** — select entity to switch the season mode between **Estate**, **Inverno**, **Estate/Inverno automatico** and **Estate/Inverno remoto**

### 🛁 Water Heater Entities
- **Sanitario Comfort** — adjustable DHW comfort temperature setpoint (30–52 °C)
- **Sanitario Eco** — adjustable DHW eco temperature setpoint (30–52 °C)

### 🏖️ Holiday Mode Control
Mirrors the Baxi app's on/off flag, avoiding accidental sends. Both entities are **disabled by default** — enable them if you use holiday mode:
- **Modo Vacanza Fine** — datetime entity for the end date/time. When holiday mode is **off**, setting it only *stages* the value locally (nothing is sent) — you apply it with the switch. When holiday mode is already **on**, changing it is sent immediately (extend/shorten the period).
- **Modo Vacanza** — switch: turning it **on** sends the staged end date and activates holiday mode; turning it **off** disables it. Set the date first, then flip the switch.

### ❄️ Cooling Control
- **Setpoint Raffrescamento** — adjustable cooling flow setpoint (7–30 °C, number entity, disabled by default); automatable via the native `number.set_value` service (e.g. lower it when you have photovoltaic surplus)

### 🔘 Diagnostic Entities
- **Aggiorna** — button to manually trigger a data refresh
- **Test Failure** — button to simulate a FAILURE alert (only available with debug logging enabled)

### 🩺 Diagnostics
From the integration page (**⋮** > **Download diagnostics**) you can download a JSON report with the current sensor values and the full catalog of commands, configuration parameters and metrics supported by your device model. Credentials and serial number are redacted. Attach it when opening an issue — it makes troubleshooting much faster, especially for device models not yet fully supported.

## Requirements

- A valid account for the [Baxi HybridApp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.baxi.HybridApp)
- Home Assistant version >= 2025.1.0

---

## Installation

### Manual

1. Copy the `baxi_hybridapp_home` folder into your `custom_components` directory.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

### Via HACS (Custom Repository)

1. In HACS, go to **Integrations** > **Custom Repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/Cm-8/baxi_hybridapp_home` as a new repository.
3. Search for **Baxi HybridApp Home** and install it.

---

## Configuration

After installation, configure the integration via the Home Assistant UI:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**.
2. Click **Add Integration** and search for `Baxi HybridApp Home`.
3. Enter your Baxi app credentials (email and password).

Credentials are validated against the Baxi cloud before the integration is created: if the login fails, the form shows a specific error (invalid credentials, connection problem, or unknown error).

If your password changes later, Home Assistant will automatically ask you to re-authenticate — just enter the new password, no need to remove and re-add the integration.

---

## Push Notification Blueprint

To receive push notifications on your phone when a Baxi alert is detected:

Click the button below to import the blueprint directly into your Home Assistant:

[![Import Blueprint](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FCm-8%2Fbaxi_hybridapp_home%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fbaxi_hybridapp_home%2Fnotifica_avvisi.yaml)

Or manually: **Settings** > **Automations & Scenes** > **Blueprints** > **Import Blueprint** and paste:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cm-8/baxi_hybridapp_home/main/blueprints/automation/baxi_hybridapp_home/notifica_avvisi.yaml
```

Then create an automation from the blueprint, select your mobile notify service and the desired severity filter.

## Limitations

- This is a cloud polling integration and requires an internet connection.
- Data is refreshed every 10 minutes.
- Currently, only one Baxi system is supported per configuration entry.
